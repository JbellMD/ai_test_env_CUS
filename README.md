# Self-Rewriting AI Architecture

## Overview
This project implements a self-modifying AI system capable of autonomously evolving its own code and architectural structure. It includes:

- Self-modifying model architectures
- Evolutionary training strategies
- Graph neural network implementations
- Comprehensive testing and evaluation
